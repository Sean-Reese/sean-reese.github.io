Hello! I am a third-year PhD student in the Sustainable Development program at Columbia Universityâ€™s School of International and Public Affairs. 

My primary research interests are in natural resources, with a focus on biodiversity and fisheries. 

I received a BA in Economics-Public Policy, a BS in Environmental Systems, and a Master of Public Policy from UC San Diego, where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude. Prior to starting his PhD at Columbia, Sean worked as a Graduate Student Researcher in UCSD's Environment and Policy Group where he worked on projects such as fisheries management, air pollution equity, and wetlands restoration. In my free time, I love playing guitar, watching birds, and taking pictures! Nerdier hobbies include watching anime and playing Magic: the Gathering.
