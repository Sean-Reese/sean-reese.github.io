Hello! I am a third-year PhD student in the Sustainable Development program at Columbia Universityâ€™s School of International and Public Affairs. 

My primary research interests are in natural resources, with a focus on biodiversity and fisheries. 

Prior to joining Columbia, I worked as a Graduate Student Researcher in UCSD's Environment and Policy Group where I worked on air pollution equity and wetlands restoration.

I graduated Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude from UC San Diego where I received a BA in Economics-Public Policy, a BS in Environmental Systems, and a Master of Public Policy. 

In my free time, I enjoy playing the guitar, watching birds, and taking pictures! Nerdier hobbies include watching anime and playing Magic: The Gathering.
